# Antigravity Editor: Tab & Navigation

This guide covers the core navigation and completion tools: **Supercomplete** , **Tab-to-Jump** , and **Tab-to-Import**.

## Supercomplete

Supercomplete provides code suggestions in a region near your current cursor position.

### How it Works

  * **File-Wide Suggestions** : Suggestions can modify code throughout the document, handling tasks like changing variable names or updating separate function definitions simultaneously.
  * **Accepting** : Press `Tab` to accept the changes.



## Tab-to-Jump

Tab-to-Jump is a fluid navigation tool that suggests the next logical place in your document to move your cursor to.

### How it Works

  * A "Tab to jump" icon will appear offering to move your cursor to where your next logical edit will be. Pressing `Tab` instantly moves your cursor to that location.
  * **Accepting** : Press `Tab` to accept the jump.



## Tab-to-Import

Tab-to-Import handles missing dependencies without breaking your flow.

### How it Works

  * **Detection** : If you type a class or function that isn't imported, Antigravity suggests the import.
  * **Action** : Press `Tab` to complete the word and instantly add the import statement to the top of the file.



## Settings

In your settings, you can customize the behavior of these features:

  * **Enable/Disable Features** : You can individually turn off Autocomplete, Tab-to-Jump, Supercomplete, or Tab-to-Import.
  * **Tab Speed** : Controls the responsiveness of suggestions.
  * `Slow`: Waits for more context before suggesting.
  * `Default`: Offers a balanced pace.
  * `Fast`: Provides rapid-fire suggestions.
  * **Highlight Inserted Text** : When enabled, text inserted via Tab is highlighted to track changes easily.
  * **Clipboard Context** : When enabled, Antigravity uses the contents of your clipboard to improve completion accuracy.
  * **Allow Gitignored Files** : Enables Tab features (suggestions and jumping) within files listed in your `.gitignore` file. Tab will only ignore gitignored files if git is installed.
