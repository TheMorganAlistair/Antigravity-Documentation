# Google Antigravity

Google Antigravity is an agentic development platform, evolving the IDE into the agent-first era. Antigravity enables developers to operate at a higher, task-oriented level managing agents across workspaces, while retaining a familiar AI IDE experience at its core. Antigravity extracts agents into their own surface and provides them the tools needed to autonomously operate across the editor, terminal, and browser emphasizing verification and higher-level communication via tasks and artifacts. This capability enables agents to plan and execute more complex, end-to-end software tasks, elevating all aspects of development, from building features, UI iteration, and fixing bugs to research and generating reports.

Main Features

automatic_cluster AI-powered IDE keyboard_arrow_rightAn AI-powered IDE with all of the AI features that developers have come to rely on such as Agent, Tab, and Command.automatic_cluster Asynchronous Agents keyboard_arrow_rightAsynchronous, local agents that can work in parallel on all of your workspaces.automatic_cluster Agent Manager keyboard_arrow_rightNew Agent Manager view for an agent-first experience built around planning mode, the conversation UI, and artifact review.automatic_cluster Multi-window keyboard_arrow_rightA multi-window product with an Editor, Manager, and Browser.automatic_cluster Browser Agent keyboard_arrow_rightAgent that can actuate the browser for you and to accomplish dev tasks like dashboard reads, SCM actions, UI testing, etc. in the Browser.

## Core Surfaces

automatic_cluster Editor keyboard_arrow_rightA fully-functional AI-powered IDE that maps to a single workspace.automatic_cluster Browser keyboard_arrow_right(In preview) Browser-use agent capabilities to read & actuate on more surfaces beyond just the IDE.automatic_cluster Agent Manager keyboard_arrow_right(In preview) An orchestration “no code” view to start and view tasks in a minimalist product focused on the conversation and artifacts.

## Key Terms

  * **Agent** : The primary AI modality within Antigravity. While the user can work tightly with an Agent within the Editor, they can also have multiple agents working across multiple codebases, orchestrated and monitored through the Agent Manager.
  * **Tab & Command**: The other AI modalities within Antigravity, specifically within the text editor part of the editor surface. Tab is a more powerful “autocomplete” and Command is an inline instructive modality. From past experience, these do not get nearly as much use as the Agent.
  * **Artifacts** : We define an artifact as anything that the agent creates to allow it to get its work done or communicate its accomplishments to the human user. These include rich markdown files, diff views, architecture diagrams, images, browser recordings, etc.
