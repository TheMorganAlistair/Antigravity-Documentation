# Changes Sidebar

Similar to the toolbar at the bottom of the editor's [Agent Panel](../docs/Agent-Side-Panel.md), the Changes Sidebar in the manager offers a quick way to see what [artifacts](../docs/Artifacts.md) the agent has created and what files it has modified within a conversation.

Clicking on any of the listed resources will open its contents within a pane. The icons on each resource indicate whether there are new changes to a resource since your last review.
