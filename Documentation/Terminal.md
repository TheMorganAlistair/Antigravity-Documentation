# Terminal

The agent manager window has terminal support as well! To toggle this, use Cmd/Ctrl + J to open the bottom pane of the agent manager, which is where terminals live. They are attached to the workspace that your current conversation is in.

**Note:** Agent manager window's terminal integration works for local workspaces only, and Agent-used terminals run inside the editor window.
