# Review Changes + Source Control

Just as in the [editor](../docs/Review-Changes--Source-Control.md), you can easily review the work you and your agent have collaborated on from within the manager.

Once you enter a conversation, you can toggle the Review Changes pane through the button at the top right to open up a pane where you can scroll through and comment on any file diffs made as a part of the conversation.

You can similarly toggle to the Source Control tab within the Review Changes pane to see changed files, stage or unstage them, and commit them upstream.
