# Conversation View

The [Agent Panel](../docs/Agent-Side-Panel.md) takes center stage in the agent manager. As the agent makes progress, you'll be able to follow along with what it's doing. To toggle off this follow-along mode, simply hit the `Following` button at the top right of the conversation.
