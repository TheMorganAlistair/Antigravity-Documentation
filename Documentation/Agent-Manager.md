# Agent Manager

We've built out the Agent Manager, to provide a higher level view into the work Antigravity agents are doing under your guidance. Here, you can work across multiple workspaces, oversee dozens of agents simultaneously, and interact with your codebase primarily through the agent, rather than through writing code directly. As agents and models continue to get better, we believe that this birds-eye view will be the primary entry point to all of your work. For now, as we continue to get feedback and iterate on this new surface area, the Agent Manager is under open public preview. We expect to move it to be central to the Antigravity experience soon.

At any point, you can toggle between the Agent Manager and the editor by hitting CMD+E (Mac) or CTRL+E (Windows), or through the Open Editor & Open Agent Manager buttons at the top right of the menu bar. You can also manage your editor windows through the manager, either hiding, focusing, or closing them.
