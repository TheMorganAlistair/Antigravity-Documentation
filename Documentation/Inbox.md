# Inbox

The inbox is your one stop shop to track all of your conversations in one place. From the inbox you can see if any of your conversations are awaiting your approval to run terminal commands, use the browser, or build out an implementation plan.

You can use the search bar and the pending switch to search for conversations by folder or by title to make sure your inbox is always focused on what is most relevant to you.

Selecting a conversation from the inbox will jump directly to the conversation, where you can continue where you left off.
