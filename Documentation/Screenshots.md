# Screenshots

The browser subagent can take screenshots of open pages or elements on pages when it would like your review of the state of the page. This is surfaced as a tool to the agent, and you can also prompt the agent to take a screenshot of a page.

All screenshots are saved as image artifacts and can be commented on to give feedback to the agent.
