# Browser Recordings

Every time the browser subagent actuates on the Browser, it may choose to generate a recording of the agent’s actions for your review. You can view this playback, if it is available, at the bottom of the Browser step UI.

All browser recordings are also saved as a recording artifact for your review. This view loops through the browser agent’s actions.
