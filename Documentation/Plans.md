# Plans

At this moment, Google Antigravity is available with [terms](https://antigravity.google/terms) to individual accounts derived from Google's terms of service, and in preview (pre-general availability) to teams derived from Section 5 of the General Service Terms in Google Cloud's enterprise terms of service.

Rate limits and model availability differs based on usage of [Google AI](https://one.google.com/about/google-ai-plans/) or [Google Workspace AI Ultra for Business](https://workspace.google.com/products/ai-ultra/#plans) plans.

All plans receive:

  * Use of Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Flash, and other offered Vertex Model Garden models as the core agent model
  * Unlimited Tab completions
  * Unlimited Command requests
  * Access to all product features, such as the Agent Manager and Browser integration



Users on Google AI Ultra or Google Workspace AI Ultra for Business receive:

  * The highest, most generous rate limits
  * Quota is refreshed every five hours



Users on Google AI Pro receive:

  * High, generous rate limits
  * Quota is refreshed every five hours



Users not on Google AI plans receive:

  * Meaningful rate limits
  * Quota is refreshed every week



These rate limits are primarily determined to the degree we have capacity, and exist to prevent abuse. Under the hood, the rate limits are correlated with the amount of work done by the agent, which can differ from prompt to prompt. Thus, you may get many more prompts if your tasks are more straightforward and the agent can complete the work quickly, and the opposite is also true.

There is currently no support for:

  * Bring-your-own-key or bring-your-own-endpoint for additional rate limits
  * Organizational tiers in general availability, or via contract
