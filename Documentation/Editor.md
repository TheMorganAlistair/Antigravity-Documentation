# Editor

The primary entry point to Antigravity is our Editor, a surface based upon the VS Code codebase but full of rich AI-enabled features designed to improve your code-writing experience.

Much of this editor is designed to feel the same as prior experiences you may have had. You can open files up, tab through them, edit them directly, get suggestions with [Tab](../docs/Tab.md), and work with an agent on [smaller](../docs/Command.md) or [larger tasks](../docs/Agent-Side-Panel.md). When you’re done, you can review your changes and interface with your preferred [source control](../docs/Review-Changes--Source-Control.md). You can also still download extensions from the Open VSX marketplace to augment your experience, through further syntax highlighting, source control integrations, or other additions.
