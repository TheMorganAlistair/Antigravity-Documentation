# Chrome Extension

Antigravity Browser Extension is required for the Antigravity Agent to access the web.

It empowers the agent to see and interact with websites to complete your development goals, whether you are building a site from scratch or automating a workflow.

It enhances the user experience by allowing the user to cancel the current conversation from the browser, switch the focus back to Antigravity from the web agent is working on, and more seamlessly work parallely with the browser agent.

The first time you use the Antigravity browser agent, you should be directed to the Chrome Web Store to install the extension.

## Troubleshooting

If for any reason you need to manually install it:

  * Click the Chrome icon in Antigravity (opens Chrome with Antigravity user profile)
  * In the editor, you can find the Chrome icon on the top right
  * In the Agent Manager, you can find the Chrome icon on the bottom left
  * Navigate to the URL and click “Add to Chrome”
