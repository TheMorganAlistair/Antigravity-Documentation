# Agent Side Panel

Use the panel on the right side of the editor to work directly with the agent. You can spin up new conversations, attach images, switch [agent modes](../docs/Agent-Modes--Settings.md), and select between [different models](../docs/Models.md).

As your conversation progresses, you’ll be able to keep track of open file changes, running terminal processes, and artifacts in the bottom toolbar above the input.
