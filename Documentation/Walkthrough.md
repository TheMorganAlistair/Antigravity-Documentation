# Walkthrough

Agent creates walkthrough artifacts when it has completed task implementation; this type of artifact includes a concise summary of the changes that have been made to remind the user of what has happened in the active conversation. This is a great way to get up to speed with the state of your codebase after Agent has made its changes in case you were not strictly following it the whole time.

For browser tasks, walkthroughs often contain screenshots and screen recordings of what Agent has built or created in the browser!
